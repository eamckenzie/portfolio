Finished versions of several projects from Coursera courses and independent work

## Project list:

### Coursera3_GettingAndCleaningData

A course project for the Coursera: Data Science track. Given the dataset (UCI HAR Dataset.zip)
and its documentation, I wrote the R program run_analysis.R to assemble the many components
of the dataset, compute the mean and standard deviations of a subset of the variables, and save
this calculated data as a new, clean dataset UCIHAR_tidy.txt. 

The README.md and CodeBook.md describe how this is done, the original variables, and the new
calculated variables. These files are in Markdown format (like this Readme), meaning that they
can easily be converted to HTML with headers, italics, and other formatting.

### Coursera5_ReproducibleResearch

A course project for the Coursera: Data Science track. Given the dataset (activity.zip), I
wrote the R Markdown document PA1template.Rmd. This is a literate programming file, combining
a written report with active R code and its results. The code runs when the Rmd file is "knitted"
to HTML or PDF format. This is a great way to make sure the code is bug-free and producing exactly
the results displayed. The R program alone, without the report or Markdown format, is saved here
as RRassg1.R.

### More coming soon!
